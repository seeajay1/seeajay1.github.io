## Knowledge Representation 
```
Knowledge representation and reasoning . this sentence have three part, first is knowledge
second is how to represent that knowledge and based on that knowledge third part reasoning,
but when we look in very depth knowledge the knowledge is a process of generation, modification,
movement, selection, distribution, discovery and evaluation of knowledge. These different view of
knowledge indicate that the 'knowledge' can exist in different form and form. So 'knowledge' is
essentially a difficult thing to understand because knowledge is also one of the ambiguous concept.
So according to Peter et al. (1992) , it is not possible to construct a formal theory of knowledge 
representation and reasoning. So 'knowledge' is an illusive and only a formal representation may 
develop confidence in knowledge sharing, knowledge sharing is not possible.
Knowledge sharing is essentially a process of interaction between individuals, groups, or
or organizations to transfer or share of knowledge that have been owned by one party with
the other party. According to Nonaka et al. (2006) , the most important for the effective 
knowledge sharing process is the characteristics of knowledge, knowledge sharing, and knowledge 
sharing process, and human resources. Nonaka et al. (2006) divide into four knowledge management
perspectives namely explicit knowledge and tacit knowledge; dynamic knowledge and static knowledge;
individual knowledge and organizational knowledge; and individual knowledge sharing and organizational
knowledge sharing. According to Flechter et al. (2007) , knowledge sharing is not an easy task, because
the barriers to knowledge sharing as a lack of trust, no values, fears, indifference and resistance.
